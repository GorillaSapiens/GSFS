**Pinky:** Gee, Brain, what are we gonna do tonight?  

**Brain:** The same thing we do every night, Pinky — attempt to create
           a lightweight filesystem for embedded systems!

**Pinky:** Ooooh, a filesystem! Will it have cheese?  

**Brain:** No, Pinky. It shall be called NARF — Not A Real
           Filesystem — optimized for constrained environments, with
           minimal overhead and simple metadata structures.

**Pinky:** NARF! I love it already! But, uh, Brain… if it’s not a
           *real* filesystem, does that mean it’s imaginary?

**Brain:** *sigh* No, Pinky, it means we avoid the bloated complexity
           of traditional filesystems while still organizing data
           efficiently. Now, prepare the code — tonight, we
           revolutionize embedded storage!

**Pinky:** NARF! Zort! Poit!
